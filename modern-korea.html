This page is part of a collection assembling links to historical primary sources that are open on the web. It should be seen as a work in progress, and corrections or suggestions for additions are most welcome. These resources may be especially useful to students of modern Korean history who are looking for inspiration and primary sources for use in their essays who a) are limited to the English language (though some Korean language sources will be listed below too) b) lack access to subscription databases that universities with strong East Asia collections may offer, and c) are in lockdown due to a global pandemic.

<strong>US Government Documents Related to Korea</strong>

In addition to the well-curated collection of documents in the FRUS collection, there are a large number of archival documents related to Korea that have been scanned. Some of these are available in commercial databases, but the Korean National Assembly Library has at least over two thousand US government documents related to Korea from the 1910s to at least the 1960s in its digital collections, and, in some cases, a single PDF file is a bundle that can be over a thousand pages in length. This collection includes materials from the US State Department, the CIA, and a host of other agencies. Most of these documents are in English and appear to have been scanned from microfilm from the US National Archives. The catalog entry for each offers a convenient PDF download link for the document, and the documents usually conveniently contain a table of contents within them.

I've not been able to determine an easy way to get an overview or index of these collections as a whole, but many of them are found with file numbers beginning with "KRDB." One method is to search for documents through their search interface:

<a href="http://dl.nanet.go.kr/">국회전자도서관</a> (Digital National Assembly Library of Korea)

This method has limits. Searching by one of the collection names, for example ("Records of the U.S. Department of State relating to internal affairs of Korea(Chosen)") in quotation marks, will still show various hits on single words in document title rather than a phrase as a whole in the field for the collection, and appears to miss many of the documents in this collection. Another fast way to do a search is to use Google itself by constructing a Google search query in the following fashion

<pre>site:http://dl.nanet.go.kr/law/ "KRDB" [Your specific search terms]</pre>

Here your search term may be a date, an event, a name, or you may want to limit your search to particular record groups in the US National archive. For example, to find all state department records, you would enter the Google search query

<pre>site:http://dl.nanet.go.kr/law/ "KRDB" "RG 59"</pre>

Unfortunately, this does not seem to always reveal all the related documents. Keen observers will note that many of the documents come in a consecutive series of code numbers, such that <a href="http://dl.nanet.go.kr/law/SearchDetailView.do?cn=KRDB20000005">KRDB20000005</a> leads to one 1919 document, and <a href="http://dl.nanet.go.kr/law/SearchDetailView.do?cn=KRDB20000450">KRDB20000450</a> leads to another document from 1950. Most but not all of the numbers between these two are from related collections, often in chronological stretches. There are over a dozen of these consecutive bundles of files in different number ranges.

<strong>Primary Sources in Korean</strong>

The emphasis of this page has primarily been on English language sources of use to students studying Korean history in a university setting that may not be able to read Korean, but below we'll add some of the many rich online sources in Korean. South Korea has an staggering variety of online databases and far fewer of them are limited to commercial subscriptions or other membership walled gardens than in most countries. Many of these are free and on the open web, but unfortunately some of them require Windows OS only reader downloads, some sources require that you be on-site, and the connectivity to some can be slow or have clunky and heavy interfaces. There are also Korean language sources in a number of online archives outside of Korea as well. 

I recommend you explore the expansive links to online resources in the University of Michigan library's <a href="https://guides.lib.umich.edu/KoreanOnlineResources">Korean Online Resources</a> website. Many of the links there are open access.

<a href="http://www.dlibrary.go.kr/">The Korean Digital National Library</a> - A huge collection of Korean books has been made available here on the Korean National Library home page. The Government-General's library of Japanese language books is also in digital form and can be found here. When searching for colonial period books, if you don't get the expected results searching with Korean hanja, try again with a search using Japanese kanji. 

<a href="http://dl.nanet.go.kr/">국회전자도서관</a> - Digital National Assembly Library of Korea. In addition to the US government documents related to Korea mentioned above, it is often good to check this library database in addition to the National Library as it has many digital materials easily downloadable as PDFs. This include many historical periodicals, though they are often indexed at the article level, rather than whole issues.

<a href="http://sillok.history.go.kr/main/main.do">The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty 朝鮮王朝實錄</a> - An amazing online archive of the most important source from the Joseon dynasty: a full run of its annals.
